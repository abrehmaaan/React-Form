🚀 Just Completed a Fun React Challenge! 🚀

Hey! 👋 I\'m excited to share a little React challenge that
I came across on Instagram, and I successfully implemented it! 💻

The question was to create an input box with dynamic functionality and a
password strength bar. 🤔

Here\'s what I accomplished:

1️⃣ I created an input box with the type set to \"text\".

2️⃣ Below the input box, I added two buttons side by side:  - The first
button toggles between showing/hiding the text as password.  - The
second button clears the text in the input box.

3️⃣ To implement the dynamic show/hide feature, I updated the input\'s
type property in real-time as the user clicked the show/hide button.

4️⃣ Additionally, I implemented a password strength bar, which is a
separate component. The strength criteria include:

 - At least one uppercase letter  - At least one lowercase letter  - At
least one special character  - Length of at least 8 characters  - At
least one number

Based on these criteria, the strength bar updates to visually represent
the password strength. Here\'s how it works:

🔴 If the strength is less than 3, it shows as \"Weak\" (in a red
color). 🟠 If the strength is equal to 3 or 4, it displays as
\"Moderate\" (in an orange color). 🟢 If the strength is 5 (strong in
all criteria), it proudly stands as \"Strong\" (in a green color).

🎥 I\'ve attached a demo video showcasing the implemented functionality
so you can see it in action!

Feel free to check out the demo video and provide any feedback or
suggestions. I\'m always eager to learn and improve further.

Thank you all for being a part of my journey! 🙏 Let\'s keep coding and
learning together! 💻📚
